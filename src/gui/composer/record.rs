//! Turning a MIDI keyboard take into Composer rows.
//!
//! **What is recorded is a time, what a row holds is a length.** The keyboard
//! gives note-on/note-off instants; a row is a chain of frames where a note's
//! position is nothing but the sum of the lengths before it. Converting between
//! the two is this module, and it happens once, when the take ends — nothing is
//! written into the composition while the user is still playing.
//!
//! **Auto-rounding.** Nobody plays on the sample. Every start and every length
//! is snapped to the nearest multiple of a chosen note value ([`ROUND_CHOICES`],
//! 1/16 by default), so a take comes out as notes a person would have written
//! rather than as 137 ms and 249 ms. Starts and lengths are snapped
//! *independently of each other* and both against the take's own zero, so a
//! rounding never accumulates: the tenth note lands on the grid position it was
//! played nearest to, not ten roundings away from it.
//!
//! **A gap is exact; a note length is rounded twice.** A length is two select
//! boxes — whole notes plus one fraction — which cannot express, say, 3/8. Note
//! lengths therefore take the nearest value the boxes *can* express. Silence
//! does not have to: a space that is not expressible is split across the space
//! frame and one or more silent placeholder frames behind it ([`split_units`]),
//! which the model already allows and which costs nothing but a frame on screen.
//! That is the trade deliberately: **a note's sounding length may be off by up
//! to half a grid step, but no note's position ever is.**
//!
//! **Chords become rows, a late release does not.** A row is one sequence — it
//! cannot hold two notes at once — so notes that genuinely sound together are
//! split across as many rows as the deepest chord in the take
//! ([`split_voices`]), all playing the same track. Notes that merely run into
//! each other are *not*: letting go of one key a moment after pressing the next
//! is how anyone plays a line, and a row each would turn a bass line into a pile
//! of one-note rows. The earlier note is shortened to where the later one starts
//! instead.
