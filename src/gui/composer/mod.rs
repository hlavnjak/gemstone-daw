//! Track Composer — arrange the registered Tracks in rows of frames and play them.
//!
//! **A row is a sequence, not a canvas.** It plays one Track (several rows may
//! share it) as a chain of frames laid left to right, each simply played after
//! the one before: nothing is positioned, dragged, or overlapping. Rows sound
//! together exactly to the extent that the lengths before a frame add up the
//! same — that is what makes a chord.
//!
//! **Frames come in pairs.** A *note* frame carries a pitch and a length; the
//! *space* behind it carries the silence that follows. They are one [`Item`], so
//! no code path can orphan a space or leave a note without one, and the space
//! has no delete button of its own. Zero length is normal — a placeholder ready
//! to be given one.
//!
//! **Every row also opens with a space** ([`Row::lead`]), which is how one row is
//! offset against another. It belongs to the row, not to a note, so deleting the
//! first note leaves it in place to lead the next; it starts at zero.
//!
//! **Length is three select boxes**: whole notes, then how many of a fraction
//! down to 1/256 — the nominator, so `3` of a `1/8` is the dotted quarter that
//! neither box could say on its own. Notes and spaces carry the same three.
//! Time is counted in [`UNITS_PER_WHOLE`]ths, so every length is a whole number
//! of units and the arithmetic stays exact. Playback lives in [`player`].
//!
//! **Frames are edited in blocks as well as one at a time.** A note frame's
//! select box puts it in the **block**, which is a stretch of frames spanning
//! any number of rows at once: "Span Rows" takes the same stretch of *time* out
//! of every row, "Clone" repeats the block in place on all of them, and
//! "Copy"/"Paste at End" carry it to the end of the composition. What keeps the
//! rows in step through all of it is that a copy occupies the block's window —
//! the time from its first note to the end of its last space — rather than the
//! frames' own extent; see [`ComposerPanel::clone_block`].
//!
//! **Rows can also be played in rather than written.** "Record & Play Once"
//! plays the composition through once and captures a MIDI keyboard against it,
//! rounding what was played onto a chosen note value and appending it as new
//! rows — see [`record`].
