//! Recording from an input device — the other end of the app from playback.
//!
//! One take at a time, straight into memory: a recording is something a person
//! is standing in front of, seconds to minutes long, and the file it becomes is
//! written once at the end rather than streamed. What it becomes is the point —
//! the take is handed to Resynthesis, so a sound can go from a microphone to a
//! Fourier grid without the user ever naming a file.
//!
//! **Which is why the name is a timestamp.** Nobody stops a take to type a name,
//! and a "recording.wav" that the next take overwrites is worse than useless. So
//! the name is the moment the take *started*, down to the millisecond
//! ([`Recording::file_name`]): two takes a second apart cannot collide, they
//! sort into the order they were made, and the file says when it was made
//! without anything else having to remember.
