//! Driving a plugin's audio, one block at a time, whatever its format.
//!
//! The track editor's audio stream and the Composer's mix both do the same
//! thing to a plugin every block: hand it the notes due in the block, let it
//! render into buffers laid out the way it negotiated, and read its main output
//! back. [`BlockProcessor`] is that, once. Everything it needs is allocated when
//! it is made — an audio callback allocates nothing — and the format-specific
//! part (a VST3 `ProcessData`, a CLAP event list, an LV2 atom sequence…) is a
//! [`RealtimeProcess`] the plugin's own module builds over the same buffers.
