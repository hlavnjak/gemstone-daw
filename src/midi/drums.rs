//! What a note means on a drum track.
//!
//! A pitch is only ever a MIDI note number — the host sends the number and the
//! plugin decides what it hits. For a melodic instrument the number *is* the
//! answer; for a drum kit it is a lookup, and "C2" tells the user nothing about
//! whether they just wrote a kick or a hi-hat.
//!
//! **General MIDI percussion is the map nearly every kit follows.** GM level 1
//! fixes notes 35–81, GM level 2 extends it to 27–87, and drum plugins built for
//! DAW work overwhelmingly ship that layout — jdrummer, for one, maps its
//! sixteen pads onto exactly the GM notes (kick 36, snare 38, closed hat 42,
//! toms 41/43/45/47/48, crash 49, ride 51).
//!
//! **Naming, not numbering, is where this goes wrong.** Drum charts almost
//! always call note 36 "C1" — they name middle C as C3, where this host names it
//! C4 — so the very same note reads "C2" in the Composer. Go by the numbers.
//!
//! So the hint here is *General MIDI's* answer, not the loaded plugin's: a
//! sampler with sixteen chromatic pads will still sound whatever is on the pad,
//! whatever this calls it. It is shown beside the note name, never instead of
//! it, so a hint that does not match the kit costs the user nothing.

/// The General MIDI percussion name for a note, if it has one (GM2 range,
/// 27–87). `None` for notes outside it.
