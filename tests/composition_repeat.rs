//! **Repeat**: the transport loops the composition instead of stopping at the
//! end, it picks up edits made while it is looping, unticking it lets the pass
//! in flight finish — and the loop can be *windowed*, trimmed at either end by
//! the two note lengths the panel names it with.
//!
//! The loop lives inside the audio callback, so this drives a real output
//! stream. With no audio device there is nothing to drive and the test says so
//! and passes.
