//! Hosting **other people's** plugins, in every format, against whatever is
//! installed on this machine. Nothing here is about our own plugin: it is about
//! the parts of a host that only a third-party plugin exercises — bundles,
//! entry points, a factory or a bundle with a plugin to choose from, and above
//! all a bus layout that is not "no inputs, one stereo output".
//!
//! That last one is why the render half matters: a plugin with an audio input
//! reads its input buffers whether or not the host meant to send anything, so
//! a host that hard-codes the layout does not fail politely — it reads
//! pointers nobody provided.
//!
//! The scan honours `VST3_PATH`, `CLAP_PATH`, `VST_PATH` and `LV2_PATH`, so a
//! directory of test plugins can be added without installing them:
//!
//! ```sh
//! CLAP_PATH=~/plugins LV2_PATH=~/plugins cargo test --test third_party_plugins -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! With nothing installed there is nothing to test and the test says so and
//! passes; run it with `--nocapture` to see what it found.
